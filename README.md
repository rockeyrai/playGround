# PlayGround

Welcome to **PlayGround**! This repository contains small projects aimed at enhancing my understanding of the MERN stack and improving my skills in React and JavaScript. 

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find several fun and interactive games, including:

- **Word Game**: Test your vocabulary and word formation skills.
- **Minesweeper**: A classic strategy game that challenges your logic and reasoning.
- **Facebook React Clone**: A mini social media platform showcasing key features of React.

These projects serve as practical exercises to deepen my knowledge and application of the MERN stack components.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I've focused on the following concepts:

- **React Hooks**: Gained experience using `useEffect` and `useState` to manage state and side effects effectively.
- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Improved my understanding of core JavaScript concepts and best practices.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the games are accessible and visually appealing across devices.
